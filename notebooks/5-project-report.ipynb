Firefighters managed to contain the Hill Fire with limited damage, but the Woolsey Fire, driven by the Santa Ana winds, went on to burn nearly 100,000 acres of chaparral, sage, and oak in the Santa Monica Mountains north of Malibu before it was contained on November 22nd.

It works reasonably well for predicting the pattern of burn severity seen in the Woolsey Fire, but satellite measurements of vegetation water content fill a similar need and proved more useful in the end. Those moisture metrics were important across all the models I tried, with high moisture contents generally predicting worse burns. This is a [well-established relationship in fire ecology](https://climate.nasa.gov/blog/3066/the-climate-connections-of-a-record-fire-year-in-the-us-west/) (albeit one I was unfamiliar with). As drought continues to grip the west, it's worth remembering that the end of that drought, whenver it comes, will not mark the end to the risk of wildfire there."
